# Gemini Pro Vision Playground

This project is a simple playground for using the Gemini Pro Vision and Gemini Pro AI models.

I created this to help others building apps with the gemini-pro and gemin-pro-vision models. If you find it helpful, please give a ⭐

Create a `.env.local` file and add your api key

```
GOOGLE_API_KEY={your-google-ai-api-key}
```

First, install packages:

```bash
yarn
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Add at least one image to use Vision.
